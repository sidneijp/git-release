- Better git integration
- Better shell integration
- Improve (a lot) the command interface (parameters and flags, etc)
- Make it configurable (environment variables, git config, repository hooks)
- Handle in a better way 'erros'
- Add generic options like verbose, output redirection, etc
- Make 'deploy' command interactive (cli wizard like)
- Break release (deploy and create command) on two stages, so user can use the release branch created
- Cover with automated tests
